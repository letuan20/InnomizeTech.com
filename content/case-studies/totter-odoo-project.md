### Executive Summary

Our customer has been in the Refurbished industry for years and they want to build a management system that allows their businesses operating on wholesale and retail e-commerce channels.

The ODOO system will be integrated with TOTTER that has been specifically designed for Refurbished businesses.

The two systems will be deployed in parallel. The first version will be installed on AWS Cloudbase infrastructure and go live after 4 months of development.

Both of the two systems will continue to maintain and upgrade in new versions in the next three months.

### The Requirement

ODOO will be used as financial and accounting management system, inventory management, and in the future they will be extended with customer care and management modules (CRM).

ODOO is an edition of TOTTER system and has been specifically designed for the Refurbished field. Therefore, ODOO will be highly integrated with TOTTER in goods management, warehouses, order management, and automatically accounting of arising financial data.

ODOO system is required to install and deploy on the cloud computing infrastructure of AWS Cloudbase.

ODOO system comprises of the following main modules:

* Accounting and financial management
* Warehouse management
* Purchase management
* Sales management
* Customer care and management (CRM)
* TOOTER ERP integration
* TOTTER Receiving App integration

### The Process

* Survey customers' current situation and needs.
* Situation and solution analysis.
* Overall system architecture design, integration model, solution design, and user interface.
* Develop, update, integrate systems.
* Testing - Go live

Industry: E-commerce, Retail

### The Solution and Architecture

The two systems ODOO and TOTTER will be separated with clear and non-overlapping roles. Besides, the data of the two systems is carefully analyzed for integration, ensuring smooth business flow, and complete data.

TOTTER and App Mobile systems act as management and operational systems specific to the Refurbished. TOTTER, besides integrating with ODOO, will also be integrated with the supplier's goods management system, e-commerce channels, and shipping management.

ODOO system manages the role of financial and accounting management system, and inventory data management. In the future, the CRM system will be further expanded to Customer Care and Management (CRM). Therefore, ODOO will be the place to receive data from TOTTER with data streams and functionalities:

* Integrate purchase order data, manage purchasing process, and automate accounting.
* Integrate inventory data, manage import, export, dispatch, inventory, and automate inventory accounting.
* Automatically accounting for inventory differences.
* Integrate sales order data, manage sales processes, and automate accounting.
* The system will also record and filter customers, supplier data, and related transactions; which is the premise for the future expansion of the CRM system.
* ODOO is developed on ODOO version 12 and installed on AWS cloud infrastructure (AWS Cloudbase).

### The Success Results

We have worked with customers and partners to achieve unexpected success in the implementation of phase 1 of the project:

* Completed editing of ODOO and integration with the first version of TOTTER in a short time and deployed in production after 4 months.
* Successfully integrated with the completely new TOTTER ERP system, ensuring confidentiality, business flow, and data closely.
* For the first time, we installed ODOO on AWS cloud infrastructure (AWS Cloudbase) and operated stably. This will be a very good solution for customers who want to save on infrastructure investment and management costs but still ensure security and system performance.
