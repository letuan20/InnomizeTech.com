### Executive Summary

InnomizeTech helped the client develop and maintain the Prepaid Activation portal for one of the largest retailers in the United States.

The Customer, a retail company, came up with an idea to release a service that would enable Sales associates to activate prepaid accounts for mobile devices. The customer planned to integrate with almost all wireless telecommunications facilities-based service providers.

Size: 1000

Industry: Mobile, Telecom

### The Challenges

In accordance with the Customer’s needs, InnomizeTech’s team built up a base website application. The solution provides two parts for both sales associates and system administrators.

The Sales Associate will help end-users to activate the prepaid accounts by completing a workflow process. The workflow guides the Sales associate to capture the required associated information of the mobile devices and integrate with the carrier’s service provider and then activate the prepaid account.
